                        shapes in a canvas, and a gravity simulator. There are also links to other projects hosted on the web that I've included. 
                        Feel free to ignore them.

                        different depending on the time of day the user visits this website. The circle also changes to 
                        a random color every four seconds.

                        These things are all accomplished using JavaScript, jQuery, and CSS keyframes, 
                        which are being used to switch between two slightly different background colors.

                        Patriotic Pirates: An educational web app where teachers can create multiplayer math competitions. 
                        Similar to Kahoot and Quizlet Live, students use their computer in order to participate 
                        in a game session. However, rather than consisting of a series of multiple choice questions, 
                        it provides free response questions where students must show their work in order to 
                        support their answer. Teachers can evaluate the responses based on their explanation and answer, 
                        allowing them to better assess their students’ progress in the classroom. After the game is 
                        over, a leaderboard displays the top students’ name and score, promoting healthy competition 
                        among students.
